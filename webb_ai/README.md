# Webb.ai

## Overview

Webb.ai revolutionizes software troubleshooting and remediation in the same way GitHub Copilot is revolutionizing software development. We do this by using AI to create and execute a debugging plan based on the knowledge in runbooks, eng wiki and open source software documentation. 

For each step of the debugging plan, we provide AI the requisite data from sources such as service logs, kubernetes events, cloud services, and code changes from github to name a few. 

Customer data shows that Developers using Webb.ai become 10x more productive and reduce MTTR.
